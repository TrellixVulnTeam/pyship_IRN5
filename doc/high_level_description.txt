- Create a virtual environment for your project like usual.
  - Make pyship one of the requirements.
- Create your a Python package (AKA a module) that can be invoked as an application with the python -m switch.
- Create a pyproject.toml file.
  - Optional: package up your package using flit. This will end up in a distribution directory, often called dist.  pyship will do this for you, but you can also do this outside of
    pyship, for example to publish your app as a package to PyPI.
- Run pyship.  It will create the following directory structure:

  <app_dir>                                                 # default of "app"
    <platform>                                              # e.g. win64
      <app_name>                                            # your app name
        <app_name> launcher executable                      # e.g. myapp.exe so the OS sees an .exe for this app
        <app_name>_<version>                                # the launcher calls into this directory (may be more than one)
          Scripts                                           # e.g. python.exe
          Lib                                               # your app and everything it needs gets installed here
        (other artifacts, such as icons, metadata, etc.)    # other things the launcher or OS needs

  For example, an app called myapp in Windows 64 would be:

  app
    win64
      myapp
        myapp.exe
        myapp_0.0.1
          Scripts
            python.exe
            pythonw.exe
          Lib
            site-packages

  - steps
    - create the launcher executable and support files and put it in <app_dir>/<platform>/<app_name>
    - build the python execution environment in <app_dir>/<platform>/<app_name>/<app_name>_<version>
    - using the application's execution requirements (from pyproject.toml), install requirements in <app_dir>/<platform>/<app_name>/<app_name>_<version>
      (specifically the Lib/site-packages subdirectory)
