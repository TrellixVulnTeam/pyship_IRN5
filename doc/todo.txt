- a re-install doesn't seem to be functional - is it doing a proper uninstall first?
- in general, check that the uninstall removes everything

- run PyInstaller directly from Python (instead of doing a subprocess.run() )
  https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#running-pyinstaller-from-python-code

- use runpy.run_module ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/runpy.html#runpy.run_module ) instead of doing subprocess.run on python.exe

- use the moto mock feature of awsimple for testing

- use Sentry (https://api.pyship.org/resources/pyship/sentry)

- this is actually a sundry todo, but extract the required parts of sundry into a new package since sundry brings in too many things for this tool
