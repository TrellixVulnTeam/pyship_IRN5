- get docstring from target app module (like flit does)

- create a "weekly" pytest capability, where it deletes the temp\test dir every day.  Note the timestamp on the temp\test dir, and if it's older than 1 week, delete it in conftest.py .
  Make it clear that it's doing so, so if pytest fails re-delete the dir.  This tests the ability to start from scratch, but don't clog up the python servers downloading
  the embedded Python and other stuff all the time.

- this is actually a sundry todo, but extract the required parts of sundry into a new package since sundry brings in too many things for this tool
