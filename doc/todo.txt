- clean up old versions.  i.e. delete all versions older than the current one in the user dir (e.g. AppDirs local)

- a re-install doesn't seem to be functional - is it doing a proper uninstall first?
- in general, check that the uninstall removes everything - it seems that it doesn't remove the clip(s), either directory or file

- run PyInstaller directly from Python (instead of doing a subprocess.run() )

- use runpy.run_module ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/runpy.html#runpy.run_module ) instead of doing subprocess.run on python.exe

- use the moto mock feature of awsimple for all testing (currently fails a few tests since moto is process based and the tables don't exist in the test processes)

- use Sentry (https://api.pyship.org/resources/pyship/sentry)
