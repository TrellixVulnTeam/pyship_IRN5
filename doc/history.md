# pyship history

I initially created a proof of concept with [osnap](https://github.com/jamesabel/osnap).  pyship uses the same principals but
with more usable, readable, and maintainable code.  pyship also has several new features.  There is a significant difference
in the two projects, so pyship is a new project instead of an update of osnap.
